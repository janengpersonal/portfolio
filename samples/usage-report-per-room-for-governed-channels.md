# Usage report per room for Governed channels

Usage report per room displays the total messages sent and received per active chat room during the pre-configured time. This article explains how Usage report per room for Governed channels works and how to configure on the Org Admin portal.

## How does a Usage report per room work?

The report is sent via email and includes the total messages sent and received by each provisioned user in active client chat rooms over the specified interval (X hours).  

**Example:** If you set the interval as 24 hours, every 24 hours, the system will send an email with a CSV file including the total messages sent and received per provisioned user per active chat room within that 24 hours.

## Limitations

For MCP mode, if a Federal Identity (phone number) is unlinked and re-linked to a different client profile, the following will occur:  
- The room is not included in the report if the re-linked profile is the only client in the room.  
- Messages from that Federal Identity are not counted as "Received by user" if the room contains other clients besides the re-linked profile.  

> **Note:** This applies to both 1-1 chats and group chats.
