With LeapXpert platform, admins can send email instructions directly to assigned Users to help them self-onboard their iMessage accounts for message archiving. 

From version **2.3.2** onwards, users who use Managed Apple ID federated with Okta can self-onboard iMessage accounts. Users can verify their accounts with two authentication methods:

*   Password only
    
*   Password and Okta Verify - Push notification
    

This guide explains how to self-onboard with Okta using email, password, without the need to use Okta Verify app.

For self-onboarding with Okta using email, and password only, see [Self-Onboarding iMessage Native for Managed Apple ID with Okta (Email and Password Only authentication method)](https://support.leap.expert/en/support/solutions/articles/151000196215)

Important:

\- Admins cannot access the Mac that has been issued to users for self-onboarding. 

\- Admins can no longer activate iMessage native on behalf of users who are assigned to self-onboard. To learn more about onboarding iMessage Native on-behalf of users, see: Configure iMessage Native integration in Organization Admin on the OS level.

**Before you start**
--------------------

### **For admins**

*   Ensure the Managed Apple ID login authentication methods are supported.
    
*   Have following permissions:
    
    *   View list of corporate phone number provisionings.
        
    *   Edit corporate phone number provisioning.
        
    *   Activate user’s messaging identities (AM users & admins).
        
    *   Deactivate user’s messaging identity (AM users & admins).
        
*   Request Mac machines set up exclusively for self-onboarding.
    
*   Enable iMessage Native self-onboarding on the Org Admin portal (Company Settings > Feature Configurations > com.leapxpert.imessage\_native.self-onboarding).
    

### **For AM users**

*   Double-check Apple ID details.
    
*   Set up iCloud for Messages, Keychain and Contacts. For more information, check [Prepare your iPhone and iMessage account: A step-by-step guide.](https://support.leap.expert/en/support/solutions/articles/151000192023)
