# **About External companies**

This document describes what external companies are, how they work, and how to manage them in the Organization Admin.

## **What are external companies?**
--------------------------------

External company (EC) is a method to:

*   Group and manage customer contacts from different organizations.
    
*   Provide controlled access to contact information.
    
*   Ensure data privacy between different client organizations.
    

### **Purpose of EC**

*   Organize contacts from different companies.
    
*   Control visibility of contact information.
    
*   Manage client relationships more effectively.
    

### **Examples**

*   Company A is working with customers from companies B and C.
    
*   Company B might be the parent corporation of company C.
    
*   The goals of EC are:
    
    *   Group contacts separately.
        
    *   Ensure employees from company B can only see B's contacts.
        
    *   Prevent employees from accessing contacts from company C.
        

Note: 

\- An external company can only have parent external company.

\- Employees can only view and search for clients in the external company they are assigned to, not in others, even the parent, same level or child external companies.

### **Examples**

*   Tech Inc. (Parent EC) includes
    
    *   North America division: US Sales Team.
        
    *   Europe division: EU Sales Team.
        
*   A US Sales Team member can ONLY see clients in North America Division and CANNOT see clients in Europe division and Tech Inc.
